        <h1>Introduction</h1>
       <p>pudina or what we commonly call mint leaves are usually used to add flavour to foods and drinks. These amazing leaves are also a popular ingredient in toothpaste, mouthwash, breath mints and chewing gums. Apart from adding flavour to your food and freshness to your toothpaste, mint leaves also provide multiple health benefits. This herb has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including digestive problems, common colds, sinus infections, and headaches. According to Ayurveda, pudina or mint leaves pacify all doshas, especially pitta and treat respiratory disorders.

        There are over a dozen of varieties of mint plants, including peppermint and spearmint, that belong to the genus Mentha. Mint leaves can be used fresh, in dried forms, brewed as a tea, or concentrated into an essential oil.</p>

        <h1>1. Treat digestive issues:</h1>
		<p>Mint leaves has been used for centuries as a remedy for digestive problems, such as gas, bloating and indigestion. Studies suggest that peppermint oil can help relax the digestive system and relieve spasms in your gut. According to a study, peppermint oil capsules helped reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by 40 per cent after four weeks, compared to only 24.3 per cent with placebo. Clinical trials in children also found that taking peppermint oil reduced the frequency, length and severity of abdominal pain. Mint is also found effective in treating nausea and easing morning sickness.</p>
        <h1>2. Improve blood pressure</h1>
        <p>High blood pressure or hypertension is a common preventable risk factor for heart disease. Animal studies indicate that peppermint tea could lower blood pressure. In one study, oral administration of menthol, the main component of peppermint, reduced 24-hour mean arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive rats.</p>

        <h1>3. Improve skin health</h1>
		<p>The powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties of mint make it effective for the treatment of skin related problems like acne, and scars. The herb contains salicylic acid and vitamin A, which help control the secretion of sebum oil in the skin and treat or prevent acne. In addition, the presence of menthol and natural antioxidants make mint leaves an amazing cleanser, toner, astringent and moisturizer for the skin. This is the reason why mint is used as an active ingredient in many skin care products.</p>
        <h1>4. Improve hair growth</h1>
        <p>Mint oil is believed to help stimulate hair growth and fight hair loss, as the herb contains a high amount of carotene and antioxidants. While the antimicrobial and antifungal properties may help ward off dandruff and head lice, the cooling effects of menthol in min help soothe the irritated scalp.</p>

        <h1>5.  Beat stress and anxiety</h1>
        <p>The refreshing smell of mint can have positive effects on mood, calm your mind and relieve you from stress. A study conducted by Wheeling Jesuit University showed that peppermint is associated with decreased anxiety, fatigue, and frustration and greater levels of alertness while driving. A few studies also suggest that topical application of peppermint oil might be beneficial for tension headaches.

            So, if you're stressed, consider having a peppermint candy, drinking mint tea or adding a drop of mint oil into your bath water to relax your mind.</p>
        <h1>6. Reduce chronic pain</h1>
        <p>Peppermint oil has been traditionally used to relieve pain associated with arthritis for years. However, there is not enough evidence to support the pain-relieving effects of peppermint. Mint oil is used in traditional Chinese remedies for the treatment of sprains, joint pains and inflammation. In a study, peppermint inhalation aromatherapy reduced the pain and anxiety caused by intravenous catheterization in cardiac patients.</p>
