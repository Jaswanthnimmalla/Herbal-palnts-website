        <h1>What Is Aloe Vera?</h1>
		<p>Aloe vera is a medicinal plant that grows in hot climates such as California, New Mexico, and the Caribbean. It contains more than 75 active ingredients, including enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, some of which could make it useful for treating diseases.

            Some people use aloe vera gel as a home remedy to treat burns and other skin conditions and heal wounds. Aloe juice is also promoted as a natural remedy for diabetes, heartburn, and inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS). There is some research suggesting that it works for these and other conditions, but more research and higher-quality studies are needed to confirm these benefits.</p>

        <h1>Aloe vera for acne</h1>
		<p>Pimples form when oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria clog up hair follicles, which then get inflamed and form small bumps. Aloe vera has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that might help with acne, but there hasn’t been enough research to confirm that it works. In one of the few studies that exist, the combination of aloe vera gel and the acne medicine tretinoin improved breakouts more than tretinoin alone, and with fewer side effects.</p>
        <h1>Aloe vera for burns</h1>
        <p>Aloe vera’s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects make it useful for treating burns. Applying a layer of aloe vera to minor burns and sunburned skin might help the skin heal faster, and reduce redness, itching, and pain, research finds. Aloe also helps prevent burns from getting infected. Aloe vera gel feels soothing on sunburned skin. It moisturizes while it heals, which may prevent you from peeling as much, When taken by mouth, aloe vera may help lower cholesterol and blood sugar and ease heartburn.</p>

        <h1>Aloe vera and cholesterol</h1>
		<p>This plant extract might help lower levels of unhealthy low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fats called triglycerides while boosting heart-healthy high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Researchers think aloe vera works by reducing the amount of cholesterol that the intestines absorb.</p>
	    <h1>Aloe vera and diabetes</h1>
		<p>Some studies show that aloe vera juice may help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and prediabetes. Researchers say substances in aloe vera repair damaged cells in the pancreas that make insulin — the hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Aloe might also lower blood sugar by helping the body’s cells respond better to insulin.

			Some studies haven’t shown any effects of aloe vera on blood sugar. Plus the studies done so far have used different types and doses of aloe. Experts say we need more research to confirm whether aloe vera improves blood sugar control in people with diabetes.</p>

        <h1>Aloe vera for constipation</h1>
		<p>Aloe vera juice and aloe latex are promoted as a treatment for constipation. Aloe contains substances (such as barbaloin) that act as laxatives. Barbaloin increases the amount of water in the intestine, which could make poop easier to pass and help digested foods move more easily through the intestines.

			Aloe juice and latex used to be in over-the-counter constipation drugs. But because aloe can cause painful cramps and other side effects, the FDA does not consider it safe to use as a laxative.</p>
        <h1>Aloe vera for heartburn </h1>
		<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a painful condition where stomach acid travels up the esophagus and causes heartburn. Aloe vera may help with reflux by lowering inflammation in the esophagus and reducing stomach acid. One early study suggested that aloe vera syrup worked as well as reflux medications such as ranitidine (Zantac) and omeprazole (Prilosec) but with fewer side effects.</p>
